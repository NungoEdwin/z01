# linear-regression
This project is a hands-on introduction to Linear Regression using Scikit-learn. Through step-by-step exercises, you’ll learn how to:

* Fit and evaluate regression models.
* Apply train/test split for model validation.
* Forecast real-world data (diabetes progression).
* Explore how gradient descent works under the hood.

The goal is to build a solid foundation in supervised learning and understand the workflow of creating, training, and testing machine learning models.

## usage
The project is organized into exercises:

 * Environment Setup – Set up Python environment and libraries.
 * Scikit-learn Estimator – Fit and predict with LinearRegression.
 * Linear Regression in 1D – Generate synthetic data and fit a model.
 * Train/Test Split – Understand why data is split and how to apply it.
 * Forecast Diabetes Progression – Predict real-world medical data.
 * Gradient Descent (Optional) – Implement regression without Scikit-learn.

Each exercise can be run independently inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

 * Python >= 3.9
 * Numpy
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Scikit-learn
 * Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
